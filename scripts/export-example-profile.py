"""Exports the owner's recent reading as the app's bundled example profile.

Reads the signed-in Mac app's launch cache (`library-snapshot.json`) and writes the folder that
`ExampleProfile.load(from:)` reads, in the shapes of the iCloud archive and the companion record
caches: `library-v1.json`, `spine-designs-v1.json`, `series-looks-v1.json`,
`cover-choices-v1.json`, and `series-links-v1.json`. The iPhone and Mac repository keeps a copy of
this script; keep the two the same. It keeps only books on the Read shelf finished on or after
`SINCE`, and only their finish dates since then, with the series, designs, looks, chosen covers,
and series links those books use. Every record moves to the account ID `example`, which no
Hardcover account matches, with its record name and work-item hash recomputed.

It strips reviews and Hardcover's community ratings, and calls no API: it reads no token, no
Keychain item, and no file besides the cache. The output is the owner's private reading history.
Keep it out of Git (`.gitignore` lists `ExampleProfile/`) and print only counts.

Run it with `python3 -I scripts/export-example-profile.py --out ExampleProfile` before archiving
(see `docs/RELEASING.md`).
